# Deep Learning like a Viking

If you'd like to test out this code here's all the things you
need to do to get it up and running. These instructions are for
Linux and Mac users. I don't have a Windows machine but if you
do, these instructions will probably still work. And if they
don't, feel free to send me a pull request with what is need to
make them work.

On to the instructions!

## Getting Started like a Viking

First off, you need a Python environment to make this all work.
I used Python 3.7â€”the latest, greatest, and most updatest at the
time of this writing. I also used ```venv``` to manage my environment.

NOTE: All these commands are run from the code folder (the same
place as this README).

I'll assume you can download and install Python 3.7 on your own.
But lets go ahead and setup the environment:

    $ python3.7 -m venv venv

Once ```venv``` is installed, you need to activate it:

    $ . venv/bin/activate

Now, when you run ```python``` from the command line, it will always
point to Python3.7 and any libraries you install will only be for
this specific environment.

If you want to deactivate this environment, you can at any time from
anywhere with the following command:

    $ deactivate

Now, let's install all the requirements. These are all listed in
```requirements.txt``` and can be installed with ```pip``` like this.

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

And you're all set to start using the application.

## Entering Runes like a Viking

Before you can detect runes, you need to build a model. And before
you can build a model, you need data. That means image data for the
runes.

Now, I've already created a few hundred runes to build a model with.
They are a series of JSON files, one for each rune, in the ```data```
folder. You are free to use them, of course, but you might want to
enter some runes of your own.

Why? Well, the runes I entered are written in my hand and so the model
they build will be great a recognizing my hand writing but perhaps not
yours. Plus, I'd love to have some extra runes for my repository so if
you wanted to create a few and send me a pull request, that would be
super-awesome!

So enter your own runes, simple start the Flask application be running
the ```run.sh``` script.

    $ ./run.sh

This will start a web server listening or port 5000. Navigate to
http://localhost:5000 and on the left you will see a run. Draw that
rune. If you mess up, hit the **Clear** button. If you're happy with
it, hit the **Save** button. When you save it, it will write out a
new JSON file to the ```data``` folder, clear the drawing canvas,
and present you with a new rune to draw. Do this as long as you
care to.

## Building a Model like a Viking

One of the things I did with the application which is inefficient but
also pretty handy is that I load the model every single time you do
a detection. This is a great candidate for caching in a real
application. However, it does result in the ability to hot swap the
model while the server is running. Useful if you're playing around,
which we are.

To build the model, simply run build_model.py:

     $ python build_model.py

It'll take a minute or two to run and will place the model files
in the ```model``` folder. At the very end, the model will be
evaluated and you will be told how it performed with a line like
this:

    Model Score: [0.4759753206629812, 0.9012345693729542]

The number of the left is the loss and the number on the right is
the accuracy.

## Detecting Runes like a Viking

Once you've got a model, you can start using it. The Flask application
that let you enter runes is the same application you can use to detect
them. So, start it up again if isn't already running:

    $ ./run.sh

Now, pick a rune from the 16 at the bottom and draw it on the drawing
canvas. If you mess it up, hit the **Clear** button and redraw it.
Once you are happy with the run, smash the **Detect** button. After a
couple of seconds, you will see what rune the model thinks you have
entered.

Repeat until exhaustion and your done.

## Thanks like a Viking

So, I hope this this was helpful. If you find any bugs or issues with
the codebase or this documentation, please feel free to send me a pull
request. And, thanks for checking it out.
